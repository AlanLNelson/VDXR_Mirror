# OpenXR Runtime Setup - AUTOMATIC ✅

This application now automatically includes all required OpenXR dependencies via NuGet packages.

## No Manual Setup Required!

✅ **OpenXR.Loader NuGet package** automatically provides `openxr_loader.dll`  
✅ **CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies** ensures all dependencies are copied to output  
✅ **Single MSI installer** will include everything needed  

## What This Means

- **No manual DLL downloads required**
- **No file copying needed** 
- **True "download and run" experience**
- **All OpenXR dependencies included automatically**

## Build Configuration

The project uses:

## Runtime Requirements

For the application to work, you need:

1. **Quest 3 VR Headset** connected via Virtual Desktop
2. **Virtual Desktop** running with VDXR runtime enabled
3. **OpenXR Runtime** set to VDXR in Virtual Desktop settings

## Troubleshooting

- If "VDXR runtime not available" appears, ensure Virtual Desktop is running and VDXR is selected as the OpenXR runtime
- If the DLL is missing, the application will fail to start - make sure `openxr_loader.dll` is in the output directory
- For development, you can test the application without VR by using the built-in mock frame generator

## Development Note

The current implementation includes a mock frame generator that creates an animated gradient pattern for testing purposes. This allows development and testing without requiring actual VR hardware.
